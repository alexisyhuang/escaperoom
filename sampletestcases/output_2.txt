You awaken in a small room, your last memory having been peacefully snuggling into bed after a long night of working on your programming assignment.
You've got to escape from this room ASAP, or you can't submit your assignment on time!
Examine and interact with the objects in the room to make your escape!

<verb>(eg. quit, save)
<verb> <object>

>>> look
You look around the room. It's a tiny crowded room surrounded by four walls. On the floor, there is a cat, a chest, and a table.
>>> look cat
You look at the cat. It's quite cute :3 There's a shiny object hanging from its neck, but it doesn't want give it to you so easily. Why not exchange it with something else?
There's nothing in your inventory
>>> kick chest
Control your temper- anger won't solve your problems! Kicking this object doesn't help, except now you have a bruised toe.(i.e. programmer did not write any script for kicking this object)
>>> kick table
Control your temper- anger won't solve your problems! Kicking this object doesn't help, except now you have a bruised toe.(i.e. programmer did not write any script for kicking this object)

The cat is angry. It scratches and bites you continuously.
You die.
